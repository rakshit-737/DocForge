   @docforge/engine — the markdown → document DOM pipeline, ported
   1:1 from src/js/engine.js (Phase 1, mechanical port).

   The public surface is EXACTLY the classic `Engine` global:
   the 17 members of the IIFE's return object, same names, same
   order. The single-file shell keeps its global via ./global.ts.

   Top-level side effects: only parse.ts touches anything at import
   time (the two marked.use calls, gfm before extensions — the same
   relative order the IIFE ran them in).
